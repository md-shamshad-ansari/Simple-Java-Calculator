# Simple-Java-Calculator
In this project I made a Simple Calculator using JAVA GUI. It performs basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and negation.
This program was made with Java and consist of two files/classes named Calculator.java and Main.java. Main.java just calls the calculator function within Calculator.java, which will call the functions to build the calculator itself.
